## 🔍 API Endpoints (All Working)

### Core Functionality:
- `POST /api/calculate_fare` - Calculate fares for all transport modes
- `GET /api/live/bmtc` - Real-time BMTC bus data
- `GET /api/live/bmrcl` - Real-time BMRCL metro data
- `POST /api/enhanced-route` - Enhanced routing with multiple options

### Testing API (Example):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/calculate_fare \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source_lat": 12.9716, "source_lng": 77.5946, "dest_lat": 12.9352, "dest_lng": 77.6245, "transport_mode": "all"}'
```

## 🚌 Real-time Data Integration

### BMTC (Bus) Data:
- Live vehicle positions
- Route information
- Occupancy status
- Estimated arrival times

### BMRCL (Metro) Data:
- Train positions
- Current and next stations
- Line information (Purple, Green, Blue)
- Real-time schedules

### Pathway Integration:
- Real-time data processing
- Fallback mode active (working correctly)
- Live updates every few seconds

## 🎯 Transport Modes Available

Your application supports **10 transport modes**:
1. **Auto** - Auto-rickshaw
2. **BMRCL Smart Card** - Metro with smart card
3. **BMRCL Token** - Metro with token
4. **BMTC AC** - AC buses
5. **BMTC Deluxe** - Deluxe buses
6. **BMTC Ordinary** - Regular buses
7. **BMTC Vajra** - Premium buses
8. **Cycling** - Bicycle routes
9. **Taxi** - Cab services
10. **Walking** - Pedestrian routes

## 🐛 Issue Resolution Summary

### Problem Identified:
- "No data available for selected transport mode" error

### Root Cause:
- `showTransportDetails()` was being called prematurely in `calculateEnhancedRoute()`
- Function was called before transport options were displayed
- No transport card was selected yet

### Solution Applied:
1. ✅ Removed premature `showTransportDetails()` call from `calculateEnhancedRoute()`
2. ✅ Modified `displayTransportOptions()` to call `showTransportDetails()` after first card selection
3. ✅ Added proper debug logging
4. ✅ Verified API endpoints are working correctly
5. ✅ Confirmed real-time data integration
